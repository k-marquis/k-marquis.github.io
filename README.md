## Objectives

## Theme Information

Stellar by HTML5 UP
html5up.net | @ajlkn
Free for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license)

Say hello to Stellar, a slick little one-pager with a super vibrant color palette (which I guess you can always tone down if it's a little too vibrant for you), a "sticky" in-page nav bar (powered by my Scrollex plugin), a separate generic page template (just in case
you need one), and an assortment of pre-styled elements.
